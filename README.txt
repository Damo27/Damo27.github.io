Simple HTML5 single page website adapted from a template to host my personal info and projects for potential employers perusal.

Hosted on github pages, editing has been done to html and css and I highly recommend using the original template, rather than the
code from this repo, if you are wanting to create something similar (https://html5up.net/astral). If this advice is not heeded
simpply clone all the files from the repo, use your fav IDE or text editor and have at it.
