Simple HTML5 single page webpage adapted from Astral by HTML5 UP to look a little fancier
and host my personal information for viewing by potential employers or anyone interested really.

The page consists of 5 sections (C-card, Projects, CV, Contact, Doggo) and a link to my linked in account. 

The contact form is assisted by formspree and the background embeded from giphy.

To use this site simply download all files load it to your favourite IDE or simply edit away with a text
editor and run the index file.

If you are intending to use this as a template I highly recommend downloading the original template from the link below.
